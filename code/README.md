## Introduction
There are three code files in the current order. Please put everything in the same directory and run cnn.py and dcgan.py first. These two files will generate two "models" folder. The "together.py" will read these two folders and train the generator again.
All the raw data are generated inside the three pothon files.
## cnn.py
This file develops the CNN model for parameter extraction.
## dcgan.py
This file develops the dcGAN model for interference pattern generation.
## together.py
This file combines the cnn model and the generator model.
