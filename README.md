## Forward and Inverse Problem of the Michelson interferometer
The current model develops the CNN to read the wavelength of the light from the interference pattern and generate the interference pattern based on the input of the wavelength.  
  
The generator are further trained to give labeled output which can be identified by the CNN.  
  
The current model is developed based on Tensorflow 2.2.
